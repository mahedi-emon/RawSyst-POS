# RawSyst — Implementation Progress

Session-continuity file. **Long-form history lives in
[`docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md`](docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md)** — this file is the short
answer to "what is true right now and what do I do next", so the two do not
duplicate each other. Serena memories `audit/verified-2026-09-02-directive` and
`architecture/counter-and-market` carry the reasoning.

### The counter model (this session's main work)

```
business (tenant) -> company -> shop (store) -> counter -> session -> sale
```

A counter **is** a `device` row. No second POS, no second table, one sale path.
`device.binding` (0104) records only how a session on it is authorised:
`session` (any user the RBAC scope allows, created active — the web counter) or
`paired` (the enrolled machine, proved by its OS-keystore secret). **Enrolling
moves a counter `session` -> `paired`** in the same statement that writes the
secret, which is the forward path to the Tauri app on the same API.

`POST /api/v1/pos/counter-sessions` re-issues the caller's OWN access token with
`did` set — same session, same user, 15-minute TTL, **no refresh token**, company
resolved from the counter. The middleware re-checks the device is active on every
request, so a pause or revoke takes effect immediately.

**Accepted trade-off:** a `session` counter is proved by a permission, not by a
machine. Tenant isolation, route permissions, company/store scope, the open-shift
requirement and an audit trail naming user *and* counter all still apply.

## 2. What is NOT done

### ✅ CLOSED — the production boot gate is market-aware

**Was:** `reportRegistryHealth` refused a production start while *any*
release-blocker was unverified, and all three unverified ones are Saudi HR rules
(`SA.EOSB.ENTITLEMENT`, `SA.GOSI.RATES`, `SA.WPS.WAGE_FILE_FORMAT`). A
Bangladesh-only deployment was fixed at the till and still could not boot.

**Now:** `registry.Health` reads the markets this deployment actually serves
from `tenant.market` (0103) on the platform plane, and splits the blockers:
`BlockingRelease` (served markets — still refuses, unchanged) and
`DeferredBlockers` (markets nobody here trades in — reported by name, never
blocking). No Saudi rule was marked verified; all three are still unverified and
still visible.

**Why relaxing the boot gate is safe:** it was never the thing standing between
a placeholder and a tax return. `registry.gate()` refuses **every** unverified
rule at the point of use whenever `requireVerified` is set, so a Saudi payroll
run fails on `SA.GOSI.RATES` regardless of what happened at startup. The boot
check is an early, loud warning.

**Read from data, not config:** a deployment's markets are a fact about the
tenants it holds. A config flag would be a hand-maintained second copy whose
failure mode is silent in the worst direction — onboard a Saudi client, forget
the flag, keep booting on placeholders.

**Known limitation (discovered, not fixed — out of this pass's scope):** the
gate runs at boot only, so a market can become served *after* the process
starts. Provisioning a Saudi tenant onto a running Bangladesh deployment does
not re-run it. The per-use `gate()` still refuses, and the next restart blocks.
Closing it properly means refusing to provision a tenant into a market with
unverified release-blockers — a provisioning-time check, and a separate task.

### 🔴 BLOCKED — highest priority

**US / International cannot sell.** There is no `US.VAT.STANDARD_RATE`, and
there should not be one: US sales tax is set per state, county and city, so
resolution needs a jurisdiction rather than a country. `US.SALESTAX.TAX_TREATMENTS`
is seeded; the rate is not. A US company provisions, sets up, and then fails at
the counter.

### 🟠 PARTIAL

- **Saudi-only rule keys outside the sale path.** `people` (GOSI/WPS/EOSB),
  `privacy` (PDPL) and `compliance` (`SA.VAT.FILING_DUE_RULE`,
  `SA.VAT.RECORD_RETENTION`, `SA.ECOMMERCE.COOLING_OFF_DAYS`) resolve `SA.` keys
  unconditionally. Phase 3/5 modules — they error for a BD tenant rather than
  degrade.
- **`reduced` is charged at the standard rate.** `sales.taxable` accepts the
  treatment while `SaleInput` carries a single rate. Only Bangladesh lists it.
  Silently overcharges; documented in the function's own comment.
- **17 of 42 registry rules unverified, 7 payloads still `__VERIFY__`.**
  `BD.VAT.STANDARD_RATE` is deliberately among them (0105, NBR named).
- **Web POS is online-only** — no offline queue, no device pairing in a browser.
  Owner's decision on 2026-09-02; offline custody is a separate later call.

### ⬜ MISSING

- Front end for the web POS counter. **Do not start the frontend redesign yet.**
- Offline sync path for browser counters.

## 3. The single highest-priority next backend task

**US / International tax resolution — make it jurisdiction-based.**

This is now the only thing keeping a market from trading. `US.SALESTAX.TAX_TREATMENTS`
is seeded; there is no rate, and there must not be a national one: US sales tax
is set per state, county and city, sourcing may be origin- or destination-based,
and exemption is held per customer as a certificate. A US company today
provisions, completes setup, and fails at the counter.

The shape this needs, before any code:

1. **A jurisdiction on the sale.** `registry.VATRate(country, asOf)` cannot
   answer a US question — rate resolution needs a jurisdiction resolved from the
   transaction (store address for origin-based, customer address for
   destination-based). That argument does not exist in `applyTaxProfile` today.
2. **A rate model that is not one number.** `SaleInput.TaxRate` is a single
   decimal. US needs a combined rate assembled from overlapping jurisdictions,
   and the same change would fix the `reduced`-rate defect below.
3. **Do not invent the rates.** They are legal values: registry rows with
   sources and verification, never constants in Go. Seeding a plausible national
   US rate would be exactly the thing Part N forbids.

Because (2) is shared, doing this also closes the `reduced`-treatment defect —
`sales.taxable` accepts `reduced` while only one rate exists, so a Bangladeshi
reduced-rate line is silently overcharged at the standard rate.

After that: the provisioning-time market gate noted above, then the web POS
front end.

## 4. State of the tests

- `go build ./...` · `go vet ./...` — clean.
- **`go test -count=1 -tags=integration ./...` — GREEN.** 21 packages, zero
  failures, confirmed 2026-09-02 after the counter model landed. `internal/api`
  ran 944s and `platform/db` 625s, so this is real database work and not a suite
  that skipped.
- That run followed 9 regressions this session caused and fixed: 8 from
  `registerTill` asserting a new terminal is `pending` (since 0104 a counter with
  no binding is `session`-bound and therefore active immediately — those tests
  are about the PAIRING lifecycle, so the helper now registers
  `"binding": "paired"`), and 1 from a `POST /platform/tenants` call with no
  `market`.
- Front end: 667 tests pass (`shared` 482, `pos` 185), `tsc --noEmit` clean.

**Lesson worth keeping:** the 5 new counter tests proved the new behaviour and
could not prove old behaviour was intact. Only the full run does that, so it
belongs inside the change rather than after it.

**Running the backend suite properly:** load the DSN first —
`cd backend && set -a && . ./.env && set +a` — or every database test skips and
still prints `ok`.

## 5. Session log

**2026-09-02 (later)** — made the production boot gate market-aware.
`registry.Health` now reads served markets from `tenant.market` on the platform
plane and splits `BlockingRelease` from `DeferredBlockers`; `cmd/api` names the
deferred rules and the served markets in its log and in the refusal. Five new
integration tests in `internal/registry/health_test.go` cover Bangladesh-only,
Saudi-only, mixed, no-tenants, and that the market set is genuinely read from
tenant data through the platform plane. **No Saudi rule was marked verified.**

**2026-09-02** — verification pass under the international directive; `tenant.market`
chosen by the platform operator (0103) with the create-business UI that had no
caller; POS pure logic moved to `shared/src/pos`; the counter model (0104), ZATCA
decoupled from selling via `internal/market`, and the country-derived VAT-rate key
with Bangladesh seeded (0105). Nothing committed — the working tree carries it all.
